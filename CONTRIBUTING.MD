### üíª Submitting Code Changes (Pull Requests)

If you're ready to dive into the code, here's our recommended workflow for submitting pull requests:

#### 1\. Development Setup

Before you start, ensure your development environment is set up. Refer to the **"üì¶ Getting Started"** section in the main [README.md](# "null") for detailed prerequisites and installation instructions.

In short, you'll need:

- Ubuntu (20.04 LTS or newer)
    
- ROS Noetic or ROS 2 (Foxy/Galactic/Humble)
    
- Rust Toolchain (`rustup`)
    
- `rosdep` and `colcon`
    
- Gazebo & RViz
    

After cloning the repo, remember to:

```
cd mechapen_ros_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro <your_ros_distro> -y
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

#### 2\. Create a New Branch

- **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the `mechatronic_pen_ros_wsl` repository to your own GitHub account.
    
- **Clone Your Fork:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mechatronic_pen_ros_wsl.git
    cd mechatronic_pen_ros_wsl
    ```
    
- **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/bug-description`, `feat/new-gait-algorithm`).
    
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main # Ensure your main branch is up-to-date
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
    

#### 3\. Make Your Changes

- Implement your bug fix or feature.
    
- **Coding Style:**
    
    - For Rust code, please run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to adhere to standard Rust formatting and catch common lints.
        
    - Follow existing code conventions within the project.
        
- **Testing:**
    
    - If you're adding new functionality, please include relevant tests.
        
    - Ensure all existing tests pass (`colcon test`).
        
    - Verify your changes in the Gazebo/RViz simulation if applicable.
        

#### 4\. Commit Your Changes

- **Atomic Commits:** Try to make small, focused commits that address a single logical change.
    
- **Clear Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages. A good commit message explains *what* the change is and *why* it was made.
    
    - **Subject Line:** Keep it concise (50-72 characters), use imperative mood (e.g., "Fix: Prevent crash on startup" instead of "Fixed crash on startup").
        
    - **Body (Optional):** Provide more detailed explanation if needed.
        

#### 5\. Push to Your Fork

```
git push origin your-branch-name
```

#### 6\. Open a Pull Request (PR)

- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    
- You should see a "Compare & pull request" button or a prompt to create a new pull request from your recently pushed branch.
    
- **Fill out the PR Template:** Our repository might have a PR template. Please fill it out completely, providing:
    
    - A clear title.
        
    - A detailed description of your changes.
        
    - References to any related issues (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`).
        
    - Screenshots or GIFs if your changes are visual.
        
- **Allow Edits from Maintainers:** Please check the box that allows maintainers to make edits to your PR branch. This helps us quickly make minor adjustments or rebase if necessary.
    

## üîç Review Process

- Once you open a PR, project maintainers will review your code.
    
- We may ask questions, suggest changes, or request additional information.
    
- Please be responsive to comments and be prepared to iterate on your changes.
    
- We aim to review PRs in a timely manner, but please understand that this is a volunteer effort. Your patience is appreciated!
